## Purpose:<br>
This project is a video streaming instructional platform.  Instructors are able to upload lessons in video and written format for others to subscribe to and learn from.  Instructors have the option to add a price for subscription to their lessons.  

## Overview:<br>
This application is a complete video streaming instructional service.  Starting on the home page, if you would like to browse courses and lessons, simply follow the green "Learn More" link in the middle of the screen.  Alternatively, if you would like to teach your own course, you can follow the "Teach a Course" link in the "Teachers" column at the bottom of the page.  From there you will either be directed to a list of available courses, or will be walked through the process of signing up to start teaching a course.
